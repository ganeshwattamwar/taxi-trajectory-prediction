# In this challenge, we are going to build a predictive framework that is able to infer the final destination of taxi rides in Porto, Portugal based on their (initial) partial trajectories. The output of such a framework must be the final trip's destination.

# basic but reasonable solution

# 1. survey paper for possible solutions
2. formulated question, especially its states
3. apply at least 1 solution to solving the formulated question
4. upload the reasonable solution to Kaggle

# Improve the solution with various models

# 1. model trajectory choosing as stochastic events
2. search-based algorithm
3. model combination

# Visualization of our algorithm and search precess for better understanding and demo effect

# 1. web ui to show the prediction process
2. figure to show the performance improvement and comparison of models
